Encrypt and Decrypt Function
v0.0.1
Edward Tian

This program shows a way to generate and solve cryptograms using ASCII code. 

It gets the ASCII code of each character, convert it into integer. At last, get inverse integer and change each digit into (9 - itself). 

For decrypting, gather the numbers and do the same operations with encrypting. 

For a further development of this function, I can add secret codes, which can help a lot with encrypting.
